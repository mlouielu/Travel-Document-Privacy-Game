## 🎮 About The Project
This is an interactive educational game designed to teach travelers about the hidden privacy risks in their travel documents. Through a series of realistic scenarios, players learn to identify sensitive information on **Boarding Passes**, **Passports**, **Luggage Tags**, and **Confirmation Emails** that should never be shared publicly.

> [!NOTE]
> The quiz is a purely **vibe coding** product built with **Google Gemini**.
